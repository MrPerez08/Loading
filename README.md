I have this interesting loading screen idea, will be using it and redeveloping it in different programming languages. (This will be used as practice for the different graphics libraries)


the objective is to create a looping rotating figure that first
    starts as a dot,
    becomes a line,
    stretches into a 3d figure
    (maybe) then it looks like a tessaract before 'shrinking' into the dot and the loop repeats



Also, plan is:
    Three.js version
    OpenGL Java
    Vulkan Java
    OpenGL C++
    Vulkan C++
    Vulkan Rust
