I have this interesting loading screen idea, will be using it and redeveloping it in different programming languages. (This will be used as practice for the different graphics libraries)


the objective is to create a looping rotating figure that first
    starts as a dot,
    becomes a line,
    stretches into a 3d figure
    (maybe) then it looks like a tessaract before 'shrinking' into the dot and the loop repeats



Also, plan is:
    Three.js version,
    OpenGL Java,
    Vulkan Java,
    OpenGL C++,
    Vulkan C++,
    Vulkan Rust,



Its so funny trying to relearn threejs because I used it to create a neat little portfolio back in my sophomore year of high school during the spring time. It only took me three days yet this project - since the inclusion of more mathematics and problem solving - I wonder how long it will take for me to complete the threejs portion of this project.
The ports to the different programming languages shouldn't be difficult whatsoever because I would have already completed the mathematics once the threejs version is done.
